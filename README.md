This repo collects tools that I use a lot, some of the tools is created by myself.

# Create HLSL file
A tool allows you create hlsl file directly in Unity editor.
Simply drag the script "CreateHLSLCustomFunction.cs" into your project, and you can create hlsl file at menu "Create/Shader/HLSL Shader".
